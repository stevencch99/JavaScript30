### To reset Camera in macOS

The answer to the prompt is persistent and the app will be listed in
**System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy > Camera**.

macOS will only prompt you once for each app. It will not prompt you again about apps in the list. If you want to change the permission for these apps, you will have to do it from the list above.

Reset by command: `tccutil reset Camera`
