## Key points
- **Canvas API**
  The Canvas API provides a means for drawing graphics via JavaScript and HTML `<canvas>` element. It can be used for animation, game graphics, data visualization, photo manipulation, and real-time video processing.

  **HTML**
  ```html
  <canvas id="draw" width="800" height="800"></canvas>
  ```

  **JavaScript**
  The `canvas` element has bunch of properties that can be configured.
  - getContext
    ```js
    const ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');

    ctx.strokeStyle = '#BADA55';
    ctx.lineJoin = 'round';
    ctx.lineCap = 'round';
    ctx.lineWidth = 10;
    ```
